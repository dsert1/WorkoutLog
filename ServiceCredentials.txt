* PLEASE NOTE **

scrape_workout.py will not work with the ServiceCredentials file - which contains a private key and client ID I shouldn't post here.

To make this program work with your own account, you must register your program to Google's servers and collect a unique private key.

for a tutorial on how to do this.
